    <li><strong>Playing Football </strong>: Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used.
      Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and
      Gaelic football.These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes. </li><br>
    <li><strong>Watching Anime</strong> : Anime (Japanese: ã‚¢ãƒ‹ãƒ¡, IPA: [aÉ²ime] (listen)) is hand-drawn and computer-generated animation originating from Japan. Outside of Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan.[1] However, in
      Japan and in Japanese, anime (a term derived from a shortening of the English word animation) describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Animation produced outside of Japan with similar style to Japanese animation is commonly
      referred to as anime-influenced animation.</li><br>
    <li><strong>Playing Valorant</strong> : Valorant (stylized as VALORANT) is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Microsoft Windows. First teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed
      beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by an official release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game started in 2014. Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series of tactical shooters, borrowing several
      mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving.</li><br>
